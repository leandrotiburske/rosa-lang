# Rosa Programming Language Interpreter

This repo contains an interpreter for Rosa programming language, written in SML.

You need to install an SML interpreter, for instance, [SMLNJ](https://www.smlnj.org/).

The Rosa interpreter can be executed using the command line to call SML, passing `main.sml` and your program `*.rosa` as an argument. For example:

> ` sml < source/main.sml examples/sample.rosa`

Have fun!
